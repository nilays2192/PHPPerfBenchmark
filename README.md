#Introduction
This repository contains our ongoing work on PHP performance measurement benchmark. To calculate precise performance of PHP code snippet we used K-means clustering algorithm. For every input code, system generates almost 35000 to 100000 test cases and derives execution time for each test case in all PHP versions. K-means algorithm will help to classify uncertainty in the results. 
User will get results in .pdf format. We have used [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) API to visualize performance stats.
